# Welcome to Atheios

Atheios is a blockchain for gaming. Beside the blockchain we are providing a framework which is interfacing the blockchain.

The framework for game developers and gamers alike.
This documentation describes how You can access the Atheios ecosystem as a gamer, app developer, game developer and so forth.

Note that all our work is transparent and can be found on github: https://github.com/atheiosofficial.

* A chain API: Chain related information can be found at https://api.atheios.org. This includes information like blockheight, difficulty and so forth.
* An ecosystem API: Ecosystem related information via https://portal.atheios.org. Here information related to ongoing games can be retrieved
* A game API: This is the protocol how to connect with Atheios
